## ACRoSS

Acommodation Recommendation System

Abstractâ€”Nowadays, online information dominates people decision making, especially in a daily life basis, as well as traveling. Many websites provide accommodation information and reviews. Hence, this information overload makes choosing the right accommodation difficult and time-consuming for users. We propose ACRoSS, a system that collects data from websites and chooses representative reviews by feature-based weighted non-negative matrix factorization method regarding predetermined topics. The benefit of this project is to help users to choose an accommodation easily. The system can classify the topic with the precision of 61%. The percentages of users that have high satisfaction in representative reviews are 55.48%.
